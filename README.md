# routerViewJS
A simple router and view engine for JavaScript.

This allows for a simple single page app (SPA) where you can incorporate URL routing and importing of view templates with JavaScript. This works great when you have a site which you are using some other architecture, say MVC, and want a single page on that site to be an SPA app instead of the entire website.

## Depencies
This relies on RequireJS. My implementation also uses jQuery AJAX but you can substitute your own module in for that if you'd like.
